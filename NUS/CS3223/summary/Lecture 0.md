# Lecture 0: Course Introduction

# Introduction

- Study the concepts and implementation issues related to database management systems.
- The first part covers the physical implementation of relational data model:
    - Storage management
    - Access methods
    - Query processing
    - Optimization
- The second part covers issues and techniques dealing with multi-user application environments:
    - Transactions
    - Concurrency
    - Control
    - Recovery

# Prerequisites Knowledge
